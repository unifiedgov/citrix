                    <p>To login to Modern Desktop you require 4 pieces of information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A username</li>
                        <li>Password</li>
                        <li>A PIN number</li>
                        <li>A token number or 2-factor authentication code</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Passwords</h2>
                    <p>Having a strong, separate password for your email means that if cyber criminals steal the password for one of your accounts, they can't use it to access your work email or Modern Desktop.</p>
                    <p>The rules around passwords has recently been changed </p>
                    <h3>Use three random words to create a strong password</h3>
                    <p>A good way to create a strong and memorable password is to use three random words. You should also use numbers and symbols to make it more complex, for example 3redhousemonkeys27!</p>
                    <p>Be creative and use words memorable to you, so that people can’t guess your password. Your social media accounts can give away vital clues about yourself so don't use words such as your child's name or favourite sports team which are easy for people to guess.</p>
                    <p>Passwords for Modern Desktop must be at least 12 characters long and include at least three of the four following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One or more capital letters</li>
                        <li>One or more lowercase letters</li>
                        <li>One or more numbers</li>
                        <li>One or more symbols</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>PIN number or token</h2>
                    <p>Before phoning the Service Desk about your <span class="il">password</span> (<span class="il">Google</span> or Modern Desktop) we would like to make you aware that the Council&rsquo;s password policy has changed.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are two significant changes: Firstly, and in line with the Government's latest advice on passwords, we have made it easier for you! &nbsp;You will now need to create a&nbsp;<strong>12 character&nbsp;</strong>password but&nbsp;<strong>this will not expire.&nbsp;</strong>However, If you suspect your password has been compromised at any time, you must change it immediately.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Modern Desktop <span class="il">password</span> (when you next change it) MUST be at least 12 characters</strong></p>
                    <p>It will need to include characters from at least three of the four following categories:</p>
                    
                    <p>Secondly:</p>
                    <p><strong>Your <span class="il">Google</span> <span class="il">password</span> is going to be the same as your Modern Desktop <span class="il">password</span></strong></p>
                    <p>When you change your Modern Desktop <span class="il">password</span> it will also then <span class="il">synchronise</span> with <span class="il">Google</span> to be your new <span class="il">Google</span> <span class="il">password</span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><br />And please remember these important steps&hellip;..<br />&nbsp;<br />Keep your passwords safe by not writing them down.<br />Never share your passwords.<br />Never re-use passwords between work and home</p>
